# Chess
A more deadly twist to the old board game, Chess.

- *Author*: Crayder

## More Details
This will just be a new minigame. A bit of an intense one. It will be based on the chess board game. It will have a chess board map and chess board pieces. Each piece will be a player. Two players will lead each team.

## Notes
- The chess pieces will be NPC's.
- For players to move, they must choose a place that is allowed for their chosen piece. If a player is there, the player will shoot the NPC that is there.
- Different pieces have different health.
- Each piece has it's own power level (to damage).
- There will only be a specific amount of ammo per turn.
- When a match begins, the leaders will choose two of three extra (bishops, rooks, or knights) piece types.
- There will be no queens.
- There will be one king.
- There will be some number of pawns.
