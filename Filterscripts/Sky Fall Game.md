# Sky Fall Game

In this game, a set of players will have a "race" to the ground, and whoever stops the lowest the quickest wins. Both the speed and the height will be evaluated.

### notes

- The ground doesn't necessarily need to be flat. Players will be able to use the height of hills and buildings to their advantage. 
- Players will have parachutes so they can dive in style, but will not be allowed to open it.
- Players will push a set of keys in any order to stop in mid air. They can be typed along the fall and don't need to be pushed within any time.
- For achievements players will be able to unlock stunts or power ups. Stunts will be like the dive animation, rolls, and whatever else looks cool while falling. Power ups will be slowing down for a couple seconds, teleporting to other fallers, and other stuff.
