# Sky Fall Game

In this game, a set of players will have a "race" to the ground, and whoever stops the lowest the quickest wins. Both the speed and the height will be evaluated.

### notes

- The ground doesn't necessarily need to be flat. Players will be able to use the height of hills and buildings to their advantage. 
- Players will have parachutes so they can dive in style, but will not be allowed to open it.
