Players will select a car out of a few spawned cars in a selection area. They will then be transported and frozen at the top of the hill. If there is only one player online then they will do single player games, mainly a global high score thing. When multiple players online they will race at the same time. Players will use traps and power ups to fight with on the way down. In a normal multiplayer race, who ever reaches the bottom first wins. There will also be other multiplayer modes, like most health and least health challenges. Players will own and design there own cars. VIP's can own more than one car (bronze can have 2, silver can have 3, gold can have 5). VIP's can use neon and smoke attachments. VIP's will be able to select from more cars (better cars for higher VIP's). Certain cars (like probably gold VIP cars) will not be able to go against non-VIP specific matches. Frequent members get daily bonuses to buy stuff with. Frequent members will unlock things. The top of the hill will curve down to the slope of the hill. The hills will be classified by height. Players can submit maps on the forum (built off of templates made by the owner). The hill's biome will be realistic, no holes in the visible map. There will be collectibles on different maps that  player's will collect throughout their career. VIP's will NOT be able to buy currency or vehicles.

There will be minigames like derbys and wall climbs.
