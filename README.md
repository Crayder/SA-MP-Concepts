# SA-MP Concepts
This repository is meant to be forked and edited by anyone with unique server or script concepts.

The repository will be sorted into the wiki and the code. The wiki is where all of the ideas will be published, and if you have examples, sketches, or drafts they will be posted in the code.



### git
In GitHub the wiki and the code are actually two separate repositories.
Feel free to add your wiki edits but keep it organized as I have it. Obviously I will maintain it also, so don't worry if you're not sure what to do.
