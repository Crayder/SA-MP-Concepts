# SA-MP Concepts
This repository is meant to be forked and edited by anyone with unique server or script concepts.

## Editing
To add your own concepts, go in to one of the three folders and create a markdown page (.md). Place the details to your concept in the following format:

```text
# Title
Short Description 

## More Details
Extra Details 

## Notes
- Note 1
- Note 2
- Note 3
- ...
```

You can customize that to an extent, just make sure you keep it somewhat in that way. Include pictures and things to help your description.

For example scripts try to keep the files like this:

```text
the vault.md
the vault (1).pwn
the vault (2).pwn
... (exclude the numbering if their is only one)
```

That's basically it, hope this repository turns out pretty cool.
