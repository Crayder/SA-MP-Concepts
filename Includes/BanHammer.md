# Ban hammer :
A simple imitation of the discord ban hammer to some extent.

-Author: RogueDrifter (Andy).

## More details:
This is basically a hammer object, falling down on the player while keeping his camera at a 
good position+lookat coords, so he could watch the event happen, while adding sound, gametext/clientmessage and animation.

## Notes:
- The player can be replaced with an NPC.
- The object for hammers currently existing are small.
- The sound id must be relateable to the subject (f*** you for example).
- The animation must be related as well.
- The place of the ban should happen at a certain place and angle by teleporting the player.
